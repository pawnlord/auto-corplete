# auto-corplete
auto-complete + auto-correct = auto-corplete  
  
## why??  
because I wanted to try and make autocomplete features and I wanted to mess with threading.  
  
## what does it do?
Not much. Right now it just lets you type things in, and as you type it will give backwhat it thinks you meant or what you want to type  

## why not choose auto-complete or auto-correct?
because I did not need to. The similarity scoring feature does both.  

## problems
currently, there are 3 problems  
1. The thread does not stop when you want it to  
2. It is only windows compatible, you can't even run it in idle  
3. weird printing order, probably due to threads (definitely due to threads)
  
I should probably get on these 2, shouldn't I.
