# auto-corplete
auto-complete + auto-correct = auto-corplete  
  
## why??  
because I wanted to try and make autocomplete features and I wanted to mess with threading.  
  
## what does it do?
Not much. Right now it just lets you type things in, and as you type it will give back what it thinks you meant or what you want to type. If you press tab it changes your word to the guessed word. If you press @ or #, it will give you the 2nd or 3rd best, respectively. It also adds any words you've already typed into the dictionary, meaning it's technically adaptive to your behavior.  

## why not choose auto-complete or auto-correct?
because I did not need to. The similarity scoring feature does both.  

## problems
currently, there are 3 problems  
1. It is only windows compatible
2. It does not allow all possible key presses (errors on arrow keys).  
3. It's kinda laggy
4. Uppercase doesn't translate when you complete the word
  
I should probably get on these 3, shouldn't I.
